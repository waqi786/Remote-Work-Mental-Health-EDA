# Remote-Work-Mental-Health-EDA

**Overview:**

This project investigates the relationship between remote work and mental health through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The analysis seeks to uncover patterns and insights into how remote work environments impact mental well-being, productivity, and overall life satisfaction. Using various data visualization techniques, we explore trends related to work-life balance, stress levels, and the challenges of remote work on mental health.

**Key Features:**

1. Data Exploration: An in-depth analysis of variables related to mental health and remote work, including stress levels, work-life balance, and job satisfaction.
2. Visualization: Detailed visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, and correlation heatmaps, to highlight key trends and mental health challenges.
3. Correlation Analysis: Identifying correlations between remote work and mental health indicators like anxiety, depression, and burnout.
4. Trend Identification: Detecting patterns in mental health based on demographic factors such as age, gender, and profession in relation to remote work settings.
